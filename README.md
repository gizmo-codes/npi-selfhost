## <a href="https://npi.omzig.dev" target="_blank">NPI Checker</a>

NPI Checker is a web app that allows you to search for practice information regarding any doctor in the United States.
Doctor information is then combined with another query that fetches the doctor's accepted insurance.
Both sets of information are then combined and displayed to the user in a table.

You can search by following:
* NPI number
  - This is unique identifier given to medical personnel.
* Last Name
* Last Name and State
* First and Last Name
* First, Last Name, and State
* Telephone Number
